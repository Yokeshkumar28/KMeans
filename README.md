# KMeans
# **Project Title**: 
# Analysis and prediction of "Mall_Customers.csv" of american mall called as pheonix to find out how many cutomers are visited to a particular shop.On the basis of prediction of production of versus spending score.

# **Disclamier**: 
# In this particular dataset we assume annual income as centerovid and spending score from the range 1 to 100 called as DataNodes of cluster. 

# **Problem statements**: 
# The american finance market as per the gdp of 2011 "Pheonix_trillums mall" as in the first range of 5.The owner of the mall wants extact which shop or product such in differnt kind of clusters in entire mall.
# AS a data scince engineer predict the futuristic market for upcoming gdp rate based on number of cluster.
# The client wants atlest top 5 cluster(shops).

# **Conclusion**: 
# According to the model basic prediction using machine learning algothim Kmens clustering we found that cluster1 which is red in color is a highest cluster which attach more than 50 DataNodes.

# **References :**
# The model building algorithm develops for all kinds of cluster values.
# The yellow spots represents centroids which is max to max only 3.
